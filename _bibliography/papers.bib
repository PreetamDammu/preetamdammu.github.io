abstract = {Suggesting relevant questions to users is an important task in various applications, such as community Q&A or e-commerce websites. To ensure that there is no redundancy in the selected set of candidate questions, it is essential to filter out any near-duplicate questions. Identifying near-duplicate questions has another use case in light of the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) - fetching pre-computed answers for similar questions. However, identifying the similarity of questions is a bit more complex in comparison to generic text, as questions entail open-ended information that is not explicitly contained within the wording of the question itself. We introduce a taxonomy that accounts for the subtle intricacies characteristic of near-duplicate questions and propose a method for detecting them utilizing the capabilities of LLMs.},
