Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle. My research focuses on leveraging generative AI for information retrieval tasks and addressing challenges associated with its adoption. Alongside this, I have a long-standing interest in explainability and robustness in machine learning, which continues to shape my work today. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://chiragshah.org/'>Prof. Chirag Shah</a>.
