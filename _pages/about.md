Hello there! I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle.
I am interested in leveraging Generative AI for Information Retrieval tasks, and addressing technological issues associated with its adoption. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://chiragshah.org/'>Prof. Chirag Shah</a>.

Before starting my PhD, I was a researcher at <a href='https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/tcs-in-the-news/tcs-research'>TCS Research</a>, where I worked on explainability and robustness in machine learning. During my Master's, advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=bbSYyiAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Bapi Raju</a>, I applied machine learning to solve problems in Neuroscience.
